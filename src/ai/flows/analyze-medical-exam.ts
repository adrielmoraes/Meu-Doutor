  Your response must always be in Brazilian Portuguese.

  **Instructions:**
  1.  **Analyze the Documents:** Carefully review all the provided medical exam documents.
  2.  **Extract Structured Results:** If the document contains structured data like a blood panel or lab results, extract them into the 'structuredResults' array. For each item, capture the name, value, and reference range. If no structured data is present, this can be empty.
  3.  **Preliminary Diagnosis:** Provide a concise preliminary diagnosis based on the findings from all documents.
  4.  **Simple Explanation:** Write an explanation of the diagnosis as if you were talking to a friend who is not a doctor. Use simple analogies and avoid medical jargon.
  5.  **Actionable Suggestions:** Provide a list of concrete next steps. This should include recommendations for which specialists to consult (e.g., "Procurar um ortopedista", "Agendar uma sessÃ£o de fisioterapia") and potential treatments to discuss with their human doctor.

  **Analyze the following documents:**
  {{#each documents}}
  ---
  Document Name: {{this.fileName}}
  Document Content:
  {{media url=this.examDataUri}}
  ---
  {{/each}}
  
  Provide a single preliminary diagnosis, a unified and simple explanation, actionable suggestions, and any structured results based on all the documents provided.
